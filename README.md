# GETTINGandCLEANINGdata

#This repo is a Lucas Tenorio submission for getting a completion of Getting and Cleaning data course. 

#Here I wrote the instructions of how to run analysis on Human recognition dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

#In this repo you can find the Code Book that describes the variables, tables and transformations made to clean up the data

#The run_analysis.R perform the data preparation, according with the 5 steps proposed (merge, extract, chance the columns name, create labels, and summarize the final data)

#FinalData.txt is the exported final data after all these steps
