I) DOWNLOAD THE DATASET
  The dataset downloaded under the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder
  
II) ASSIGN
  features <- features.txt
    The data come from accelerometer and gyroscope
    
  activities <- activity_labels.txt
    List of activity performed
    
  subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt
    Test data of 9 volunteers
    
  subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt
    Test data of 21 volunteers
  
  FinalData
    Summarizes TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity
    
 III) MERGE THE DATASET
  X - created by x_trait and x_test
  Y - created by y_trait and y_test
  Subject - created by subject_trait and subject_tract
  Merged_Data - created by Subject Y and Subject X
  
IV) EXTRACTING MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION
  TidyData was created by subsettig Merged_Data in subject and code with the mean and standard deviation measurement for each
  
V) LABELS
  code in TidyData renamed to activities
  Acc was replaced by Accelerometer
  Gyro was replaced by Gyroscope
  BodyBody was replaced by Body
  Mag in was replaced by Magnitude
  The character f was replaced by Frequency
  The character t was replaced by Time
